            My name is Veronica and I am a graduate from UC Santa Barbara. 
            I have a solid foundation in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
            I am passionate about using data science to improve public health and contribute to the medical field 
            in order to help people in need.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also love anything art-related, especially fashion. 
            I have been running my own online resale business for 5+ years now where I am in charge of my own shipping logistics, 
            product research, and fashion forecasting.
